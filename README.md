# P-Word-Gen

## Password Generator Assignment

My task for this assignment was to create a password generator. I was required to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. 

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

I utilized html, css, javascript and git to complete this homework assignment.
